to write recurrence of DP problems:
1) try to represent the problem in terms of index.
2) do all possible stuffs on that index according to the problem statement.
3) if question says: count all the ways -> sum of all stuffs
                     find min -> min of all stuffs.
                     find max -> max of all stuffs.

convert recurrence to DP
1) declare array dp[n+1]
2) before returning store the value and then return it ex.-> return dp[index] = min(left, right)
3) check if its previously computed or not. If yes then return it ex.-> if(dp[index] != -1) return dp[index].
